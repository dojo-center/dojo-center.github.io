## Balance Within, Excellence Beyond

 We started **Mindset Dojo** because we found ourselves working with various leaders and strategies within **Fortune 500 companies**, all struggling with the **execution** and **sustainability** of those strategies. As we worked with these business leaders and teams, we discovered a common element across these challenges: **internal blocks**.

To successfully implement strategies in business, we had to **identify**, **surface**, and **resolve** these internal blocks within the leaders themselves and key members of their teams. As we addressed these barriers and the dojo evolved, we found that people began applying these same tools and skills in their **personal lives**.

We are inspired that as our community members develop greater **inner balance** and learn to navigate **high-stakes, conflict-driven, and chaotic situations**, while integrating the **emotional** and **social intelligence** from our methods, they begin to demonstrate **increasing levels of excellence** that **transcend boundaries**.
