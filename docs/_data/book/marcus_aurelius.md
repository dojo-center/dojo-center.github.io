## Marcus Aurelius and change

Marcus Aurelius was a second century Roman emperor. He presided over what was known as the "Pax Romana", or the high water mark of the Roman empire. This was marked by (relative) peace and stability, allowing both the emperor and the citizens time to be more cicumspect and philosophical.

Marcus Aurelius was a follower of stoicism, and applied the peace and acceptance of stoicism to his leadership of the empire. 

He wrote down his thoughts in "Meditations", focusing on his thoughts on stoicism and how it can be applied to everday life. This work continues to be extremely popular and taught worldwide. 

I would like to use some quotes from "Meditations" that seem applicable to the Mindset Dojo, and give my thoughts on the details of how they apply.

1. Willingly give thyself up to Clotho [one of the fates], allowing her to spin thy thread into whatever things she pleases

When we consider the world as a whole, or even narrow it down to the industry you are working in, can you predict what will happen in the next 10 years? If you think you can, can you control those changes? Can you even influence those changes at a global level?

For most of us, I believe we are able to influence our more localized organizational unit.  This can have meaningful impact on myself and those around me, but then stops at that level.

Some more influential people or groups can cause a degree of change in the industry as a whole. The ultimate example of this is someone at Steve Jobs' level.

Accepting that our organizations, and the industry as a whole, will evolve in directions we can't change or even influence is the nature of the acceptance of fate.

For example, global market shifts will occur regardless of the health of any individual company. The effects of the change may impact the company despite their best efforts, for example, investment money being pulled away in especially hard economic times.  

It provides no benefit to complain about these changes when we cannot influence them. What we want to do, is to prepare as best we can for them. While a company cannot prevent investors from pulling away funds, they CAN grow at a sustainable level so that the affects of a market downturn have a minimized affect on the company. 

In the end, you want to influence what you can in a way that benefits you most in both good times and bad. Be aware of fate and how things can change quickly, and set yourself and your organization up for success in both of those conditions. 

2. Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream ; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.

Change in your organization may not always take the form of drastic, immediate change coming internally or externally. Change happens mostly simply by the passage of time and the normal changes that accompany that.

One common change is the simple exit of existing employees and the onboarding of new employees. These may be in your organization, or in the larger company. 

Retention of employees is treated differently depending on the leadership of the company and the prevailing amrket trends at any given time. 

In the "Good to Great" book series (Collins and Porras), retention of employees is stressed as an important success condition. This is due to the high cost of losing subject matter expertise as well as the cost of bringing new employees up to speed on the core functionality of the products they support, much less expertise on adding new feature functionality.

But there may be conditions where turn over is actually favored by the company. This may be because of outlook of leadership that turnover brings in new ideas and energy. Or it may be due to market forces, including investor support for the turnover. Due to fiduciary responsibility of leadership, it may be a necessity for turn over in this case.

But even without a forced condition for turn over, people leaving and new people coming into the company will still occur. Accepting this, and preparing for this, is critical strategic planning for any organization. 

Another force of time that will occur, outside of any other mitigating factor, is the change in relative value of your product. This may be due to natural competition that will appear over time (even factoring out a competitor specifically focusing on your product), or that the value of what the product provides simply changes due to market changes.

Knowing that these changes will occur, the company should have strategic product road maps so they are ready for change. You will want to periodically and consistently revisit the product roadmap knowing that the change will occur in the market regardless of your actions.

Accepting that these changes occur over time, and that they are natural and expected, makes everything more functional.

Consider this situation as well: you have a conflict at work with someone else in your organization. Your options (depending on the severity of the conflict) may range from talking to your boss about it, talking to your colleagues and soliciting advice, all the way to the somewhat drastic actions of either quitting or bringing the situation up to your human resources department (again, depending on the severity of the conflict).

There is another possibility: to allow time to possibly alleviate the issue. Given the egress of employees in a corporation over time, or the prevalence of reorganizations within companies to alleviate perceived blocks, it's entirely possible that any conflict disappears over time by simple untangling of the two parties involved. It takes patience and fortitude to try and use this solution, and it's not appropriate in every case (especially if the conflict is acute), but consider this action in the future as a possibility. It may be the ultimate exercise of the stoic attitude of embracing change over time.

3. If sailors abused the helmsman or the sick the doctor, would they listen to anybody else ; or could the helmsman secure the safety of those in the ship or the doctor the health of those whom he attends ?

This can also be summarized in the quote from Abraham Lincoln: "A house divided against itself cannot stand." 

A organization member will have specific goals to meet to achieve success for the whole. An engineer may have tickets for features or bug fixes to track this work, a sales person will have sales targets, etc.

Now imagine that the team member has a combined issue of not only not believing in the leadership of the organization, but in some way attacks the leadership goals and integrity.  This may take the simple form of ongoing critical attacks on leadership in meetings, or in a more worrisome manner of moving slowly on work or even stonewalling progress completely on tasks that they have issue with.

For a second example, imagine an architect discussing a new project with the team, and coming to a decision on the choice of tools going forward. Then imagine a team member not agreeing with the decision, and instead of deferring to the majority or leader decision. giving some trivila reason why they were blocked on implementing the change, and instead chasing down a completely different task. 

Now consider a converse situation:

A leader of an organization must have the support of those they depend on to deliver value. They must provide the members of the organization with the tools they need to succeed at the target goal. Included with this is sheltering the organization from distractions that would deter them from the goal.

So if a leader is attacking members of the organization, they are by definition not doing their job. Team members won't be able to maximize their contributions if they need to fight off leadership at the same time they are completing work. In this case the leader is sabotaging the team member and the organization, they are sabotaging themself as well. This will also not only have a short term degradation of delivery, it will also have a long term deleterious affect of losing team support,

So how to mitigate this issue?

The book "Built to Last" (Collins and Porras) suggested the process of transaparent talk between all individuals in an organization. This leans hard on the safe dialogue condition of the Mindset Dojo. When people feel safe, they will give honest, valuable feedback. 

For the situations I described above, there is a critical next step after the honest dialogue of "Built to Last". And that is that there is a decision made, and all parties agree to give their all to achieve the goal. This is critical, because while a team member may disagree on an item, they recognize the authority of the majority decision and give all their effort to see that the goal is achieved.

Leadership needs to buy into this goal as well. A leader needs to listen to the feedback of the professionals they have gathered, the aggregate experience of a team will always be larger than the experience of one leader. So if the leader has done a good job of assembling a team, any attacks against their opinion is in fact a challenge to their own decision making in choosing that team. There will be situations where an organization decides to go in a direction that may counter a leader, and the leader needs to allow this to happen when the weight of opinion and facts determine it.

4. Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change ? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature ? And canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change ? And canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change ? And can anything else that is useful be accomplished without change? Dost thou not see then that for thyself also to change is just the same, and equally necessary for the universal nature ?

Change is not only inevitable, but it's necessary for progress.

To put it into terms of the tech industry, there will be continuous updates to hardware (making everything more faster and more powersul) as well as larger changes in technology (AI being the current big change).

A common reaction to change is fear. Imagine this situation:

Your organization has created a product that is popular with customers. Your organization if right sized to support the product for the forseeable future.

Now there is an introduction into the industry of a disruptive technology that is relevant to your product. You realize that you don't have any expertise with the technology in your current organization.

Imagine yourself as a leader of this organization, how do you react?

Like I mentioned, one common reaction is fear. There is a technology that is disruptive, affects my product, and my team does not have experience with this technology.

You may want to change your current product roadmap to take the new technology into account. This may mean postponing features for your current product. Or if you feel this is not enough, you may want to change your organization's process to meet the challenge. This might manifest itself as moving into Agile development, or if you are already Agile, moving from Kanban to Scrum or vice versa. Or you may want to add more steps or artifacts for product or project management to track progress on the disruptive technology. Without any way to test this change beforehand, this will be impactful, and potentially will have a negative affect instead of the anticipated positive.

A more destructive change would be to reorganize you teams to try to deal with the change. This may be because you believe some members of your organization, while not having experience with the disruptive technology, have a better ability to adapt to the change. If this change is agreed on with feedback from the team, it may be wortwhile to change. But if you are a leader making this change unilaterally, do you know all of the people affected by the change, and their very specific strengths and weaknesses? Do you know how they will interact with other team members after the change? Are you convinced of the ability of your organization to adapt if this change does not work out?

The most destructive change would be to lay off people in fear of the change. The assumptions of the layoffs may mean 1) our organization cannot adapt to this change and we must scale back until we determine the final outcome of the indistry change 2) we need to scale back because I assume we will fail in adapting to the technology change, and the investors will reward this assumption, but if we somehow weather this change we will regroup afterwards and maybe hire again 3) we will fail this change with current resources, but if we hire people with existing experience with this disruptive technology then we will potentially succeed, although we will need to get the new people up to speed on our product before than can be meaningful pay off from this change.

All of these changes originate from fear, and the assumption of failure.

But what if we already anticipate change? If like Marcus Aurelius, we realize that change is not only inevitable but the necessary agent of progress, we will instead look towards tranformational change.

What if we instead look to quickly upskill our current team on the dispruotive technology. If the team has created your successful product, why would we assume that they are not able to succeed at this change as well?

I worked in an organization when the mobile phone app disruption occurred. The company pulled a certain number of people off of their current work (myself included) and had them work on the mobile solution. There were a couple of strategic hires, and some contract work as well. If I remember correctly, the target that was hoped for, a 12 month target, was complete in 6-8 months.

Why did we succeed?

Because the leadership asked already successful people to focus on a new challenge and bring their talents towards a new goal. And the goal was achieved ahead of time and more complete than even hoped for at the beginning. 

If we anticipate change, if we welcome change because it's the nature of change to spur progress, then many things are possible.

Look at one of the choices above from a different lens as well:

If I am a member of an organization, and I anticipate there will be bad economic times after good times, should I be surprised when layoffs and change happens?

Loss of a position is a door closing, but it is also a door opening to many possibilities. Is there something you would rather be doing than the position you previously held? Is there a passion project you can start as a result of the change? Will you consider change and growth in your career in new and unexpected ways due to the event?  All of these are possible after what might be perceived to be a negative change in your life.

The same can be said for reorganization as well. If you are afforded a new opportunity in a company different than the position you were hired for, how will you take that offer? Will you look at it negatively as impactful against your projected career path? Or will you go with the flow of change and try out something new?

Taking into account Marcus Aurelius' words, I think there are two main takeaways we can use: 1) as a leader, look to transformational change for your organization vs destructive, disruptive change as the first go-to option. Have confidence on successful people to adapt to change 2) as a contributor, anticipate change and adapt to it when it occurs. Don't waste energy fighting against or feeling bad about the change. The door that has been closed due to the change has led you to a hallway with a hundred other doors ready to be opened.

5. Contemplate the formative principles [forms] of things bare of their coverings ; the purposes of actions ; consider what pain is, what pleasure is, and death, and fame; who is to himself the cause of his uneasiness; how no man is hindered by another ; that everything is opinion.

A hugely tranformational change that can come about from the Mindset Dojo is to view the world from a different viewpoint.

Consider this challenge to your organization: a very valuable team member, who is the resident subject matter expert on a product feature, has accepted a position and will be leaving the team. In addition, there is a hiring freeze and you cannot look for a new person to take their place. What are your options?

One option is to not address the issue. This may play out as waiting for an unknown amount of time hoping that budget will eventually be allocated to backfill the person that was lost. The downside is that any new feature enhancements or even support of the current feature may be put on hold until the new resource is allocated. In a worst case scenario you will not have the expertise to support a feature that is actually critical for your product which may result in customer down time and loss of value.

Another possibility is to try and convince the leadership that the person that was lost has to be replaced and resources have to be freed up for this. This is not necessarily a bad thing to do as a secondary action, but since "hope is not a strategy", it's a sub optimal plan for the future.

For both of the actions (or inaction) above, you may also be tempted to complain of the reality of the situation and the circumstances that led you there. This may be internal compalaints among the team to each other, or may spread as people on the team interact with the larger company. This action can have a corrosive affect on the morale of people involved in the discussion. In addition, complaints of the situation don't have any positive affect on the situation to resolve it. 

The way to positively engage with the situation is to ackowledge and accept it, and then figure out the practical solution to it given the limitations. In ths case, the inability to add a resource to cover the one that was lost
limits our choices. 

So we have to cover the needs of this position with existing resources. We might want to have several resources cover this, or one dedicated resource. 

Ideally you will want to start the hand off of the functionality before the existing subject matter expert leaves your organization. Set up daily meetings between the resource that is leaving and the one(s) taking over the responsibility. Get as granular as possible in day to day responsibilities and expectations for the feature. 

The person who is exiting may have suggestions about what is both optimal and suboptimal about the current feature. Note down all of these, and embrace the possibility of change for the future implementation.

When you embrace the necessity of the change and possibilities that it opens, then the change goes from being an impedance to being an opportunity. Change will present the possibilities for improvement and progress for the future, many times it is a simple act of embracing the change for those possibilities to reveal themself.
