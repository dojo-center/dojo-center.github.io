## David Hume and the concept of self

David Hume was an 18th century Scottish Enlightenment philosopher. Hume investigated philosophy of the mind. He rejected the concept of knowledge and ideas were objectively true outside of human mind, and argued that knowledge derives from our subjective experience of the world. Let's look at how some of Hume's ideas apply to mindset and the corporate world:

1. The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations.

Imagine your organization in the worst situation possible. Your product is way behind the market standard and has huge technical debt, your budget is frozen and you can't hire new people or backfill any people that leave, there are periodic reorgs that disrupt the little progress you are making, the team has contention about architectual choices, you are getting pressue from leadership that your team in not delivering quickly enough...

But if you take a step back: is all of this an objective, measureable reality? Is this situation something other people will also recognize completely? Or will some people, even folks aware of the whole situation, see some parts of this differently? Are there even some people who know of the situation say you are doing just fine?

Consider if you have ever been in this situation, because I have. Our organization was in almost the exact situation described, with our team struggled to deliver value. We waffled between Scrum and Kanban to try and fix the issue, to no avail.

But when I met with my boss for my yearly review, I received a promotion and a raise.

In that case, was I wrong? Or were other people looking at the situation perceiving it incorrectly?

Also consider the case where everything seems to be working perfectly, deliveries and teamwork is stellar. The organization has stabilized, there are no periodic, disruptive reorgs. The financial status of the company is great.

Then consider someone giving you negative feedback during this time. They may be critical of some aspect of how things were accomplished.

This situation also happened to me. Our team was asked to completely redo our production deployment process. The company had been relying on a propietary, licensed solution for deployments. But when the vendor raised the license cost,  we were asked to enter this deployment realm (we had previously been an R&D facing team, without production responsibility) and write our own processes to handle the same work. 

Over the course of some months, we accomplished this task.  Some time later, when I was working on an unrelated project, someone told me that the work that was done for production deployments was bad. In their words, "I would not have done it that way."  Keep in mind that our solution was our own code and had no license costs, and was successfully maintaining and updating all relevant production components.

Given the above scenarios, who is "right" and who is "wrong" in those cases?

This points out the applicability of Hume's words.  All of the people above were watching the same things occur, but their perception of the meaning of the situations differed wildly.

Consider this: have you ever misheard the lyrics to a song? And not realized the mistake until months or years later? You might talk to someone who knew the correct lyrics all along, maybe this is the person who corrects you on them. Is your enjoyment of the song necessarily less than the other person because of it?

Or consider seeing a movie or television show with someone, then talking about it afterwards. Did you ever have different takes with someone on the meaning of the show, or what you saw as the focus of a show? Or did you ever describe your take on this, and then have a person tell you they had never considered that aspect and meaning that you pointed out. Is there someone who is "wrong" and someone who is "right" in that situation?

If you are in either a condition of strife or a condition of success at work, you are always still in a theater of your mind on the situation. Given a big enough organization, your perception of any given situation is guaranteed to differ from at least one other person aware of the same situation, more likely you are going to be in disagreement with many people. And it won't be only a two option answer, there may be as many perceptions of the situation as people involved in it. In fact, for the subtler points of your organization's situation, this is guaranteed.

Now consider the world outside your job and organization. Have you ever disagreed with someone on a political or world view? Almost certainly, even if you don't talk about these items often. Consider how even something as straight forward as voting leads to wildly split results between people. Leaders are sometimes elected without even a majority of the vote, when there are more than two candidates. Who is right and who is wrong in this situation? Are the people who voted for a candidate who did not get elected "wrong"?

The truth is that we are moving through complex situations using our own individual and specific outlook on them. It's not only a case of how we see the specific current state, we bring to that perception all of our previous history to how and why we perceive it that way. If you have ever trusted someone and then been let down, you may remember that situation. Now consider you are working with members in an organization who remind you of this person who betrayed your trust, even though they may not have done anything to elicit that response. Will that affect how you perceive their contributions to your org? Will that then affect your perception of whether you are in a state of success or failure?

In the end, progress in an organization is the functional coming together of people who, while they have wildly different takes on a situation, agree enough on the principal parts to make progress.  

2.  A ship, of which a considerable part has been chang'd by frequent reparations, is still consider'd as the same; nor does the difference of the materials hinder us from ascribing an identity to it.

This is a rewording of the classic description of the Ship of Theseus. 

If a ship is preserved in a museum, and parts are gradually replaced as they age and degrade, until all of the parts are eventually replaced, is it still the same ship?

Consider some situations how this applies to the tech world...

Imagine you have an idea for a new product, and start the idea for a new site to host the product. You choose the name for the product and the corresponding site name. You want to register the name for the product and the site so you don't lose access to it as it develops. You want to get an early placeholder for the site as it develops, so you bring it live on the web with a simple hello world message.

Imagine you get some funding for the product and hire people to help foster it along. The product is developed, and the site has pages added to direct people to the purpose of your product and how to engage with the company.

Now several years later, the site and the product are mature and have customers and a strong team to support the product. The site has many supporting pages, the logo and font are now all different, and the original hello world page has been removed.

So is it the same site that existed at the start? It may have the same name and purpose as the original site, but everything else about it has changed. 

Also consider this situation: you are hired at a company as it is growing. The product is in its early stages, with some functionality but a lot of promised future features. The organization is several dozen people strong at this point.

Now, imagine the situation several years later: the product has been successful and the company has grown. There are many new employees, and many of the people you knew at the early stage of the company have left. You are still with the company, and you have been given the opportunity to change jobs and work on different tasks and progress with the company.

So is the company at the end the same thing as at the beginning? If it is, what parts constitute the connection with the original?

We can see the value of this exercise as it applies to Mindset. The change in details for the progress of an individual, for a product, and for a company are expected and necessary for progress over time. The invetibility of change introduces the question of form that constitutes Hume's idea. 

What this can teach us is that holding onto any aspect of the past as these items progress is unecessary and even counter progressive. 

If, for example, a member of the organization introuduces a new idea for the product. If you react in a negative way, is it because it is truly a bad idea, or that the new feature conflicts with your concept and picture of the product from the past?

Now picture the change in members of the organization. There will be people leaving the company that you know, some of them you may have close connections with. If you react negatively, is it because the change is going to negatively impact the company? Or is it a reaction against the progress of members of the company over time, and the fact that this will continue to change in the future?

Losing colleagues to change is difficult. If you are close to a person who is leaving, this can almost feel equivalent to a death. Due to constraints of time, you may in fact not interact with the person who leaves again.

If the interaction is very important to you, you may want to proactvely connect with the person outside of workplace connections so that you can have continuity with this individual in the future. But either way it turns out, the day to day interactions will change.

And now imagine you feel that it is your time to leave the company. It may be because you have tried all available positions and have no more to learn, and you are ready for something new.

Both you and others in the company might feel some negative emotions due to this change. But if we consider all of the above, this is the necessary action to enable progress, in your personal growth, career, and even the corresponding growth in individuals who are left behind in the company to try and cover your contributions.

All of these outcomes may end up being a net positive for all involved in the long run.

In the end, if you look at all of these things, a product, a company, yourself; the change over time is necessary for progress. While our vision of any of these items at any given point of time may be how we picture it, these are really just snapshots in time of the status of a thing. These things will keep a name, a purpose, and a basic form; but otherwise they will change and progress as needed.

3. In this view, therefore, memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions.

In terms of personal identity, you may have a title that you ascribe to yourself currently. Engineer, salesperson, executive; these are titles that we assign within industry.

What do these mean in reality though?

For example, a title of "Software Engineer" is a very common, but broad, title. Is the engineer a Java or Python expert? Are they a devops developer, or a front end, or SRE? Are they the only engineer working on a product, or part of a large team? 

Titles in a company are almost always assigned by HR or leadership, vs self assigned. So to take a place in an organization, you will have to take on a title like Project Manager or Front End Engineer or CEO. This fulfills a need for the company and helps check a box for an open position.

Does this title convey everything about you?

Definitely not, because it doesn't elaborate anything about your personal life, your hobbies, your friends and family, your likes and dislikes, or your past or future.

Does it encompass everything about you even within the company? Probably not. Most people wear many hats in their jobs. You may have to interact with your agile team as a team member, but possibly put on a scrum master or even a product owner hat as needed. A people manager may need to be a product owner, project manager, and a subject matter expert as needed. Individuals in a small startup may need to wear many hats concurrently as needed, with a lot of context switching. This is a common scenario.

But while the titles can't encompass our true value or even the specific tasks we are doing at any given time, we may cling to them.

Consider this situation: you have a title as a Senior Marketing Manager. Because of changes within the company, that title has been eliminated, your title is now going to be Marketing Manager. How would that make you feel?

Most people would find that situation unacceptable. Even if your pay and responsibilities did not change, you will probably view this change as an unecessary and even insulting downgrade of your status.

Imagine if this change did not affect your value in the industry as a whole, that is your resume will reflect the change but you don't expect it to affect your pay or offers from any other company. Would the change be acceptable at this point?

Again, I think most people will still find the change negative or even still unacceptable. 

So what is the purpose and meaning of these titles? If we cannot easily move people around them as needed, why are they there?

The value to a company is to ascribe responsibility and then ideally understand the value that is being produced by any given title. For example, if we have X QA Engineers and we find we have an unacceptable level of quality in our product in production, this might affect the people in this title. We might think there need to be more QA Engineers (the quality is due to lack of resources), or we might think there should be new people in this position (shifting other engineers into QA and QA into configuration management might be an option), or that the people or technical leadership of the title is suboptimal (we might want to change the leaders of the QA org).

But what is the value of the title to the individual? In the example above, some people may resist or even leave the company if they are moved from QA to configuration management. They may be tied to the title and the specific work that entails and see it as a value loss if they change.

But this perspective may be due to our emotional ties to the title vs any true objective value. We may picture ourselves as a QA Engineer. And when I succeed at this job, I will expect a Senior title, and then an offer to be a manager or architect, then a Senior Manager or Director title, etc. I may have a specific narrative laid out for how my career should progress.

Would it change a person's mind if they knew that, for example, a full stack junior engineer hired directly out of school makes more money than a Senior QA Manager, because their value is perceived as higher by the company? Or that people in marketing are on a faster track to a leadership position?

Is there a way to avoid clinging to a title? 

Outside of work, you will probably discuss work with friends and family, but most likely move on to many other subjects. Does your title influece your friends and family on your opinions and the reason why they want to be around you? Are they your friends due to your title or the money that comes from it?

Most people have close friends and family that love them for reasons that have nothing to do with job title or compensation. So if we step back and understand that, the meaning of the title should lose value and be more flexible in how we approach it. 

4. Truth springs from argument amongst friends.

A Dojo circle is a coming together of peers who want to focus on a particular domain of learning, such as Mindset. 

One of the most important aspects of the circle is that it requires safety in dialogue, in that a person can speak their opinion without fear of any kind of retribution.

I have experience with applying the circle model to other organizational meetings. Tbe expected outcome of the meeting depended on the purpose and was wildly different, including an architectual decision record, a product roadmap, and assumption map, etc.

But the form of the meetings was to first invite all needed subject matter experts into the call. We need the people who are knowledgeable and have a stake in the decision. We set the expectation and target ahead of time in the invitation so people know what subject we are discussing.

The facilitator may need to gently enforce the safety of the calls. This could be due to subject matter experts and their direct manager being in the same call, and the experts feeling intimidated to share their knowledge honestly. The facilitator may need to call on individuals who are reluctant to talk to make sure they feel free to state their opinions. 

People managers themself may accidentally revert to conversation modes that are not safe in the calll simply out of habit. The facilitator again needs to gently move that back to a safe place for all involved.

What I have noticed is that when you apply this method to these conversations, the value of the meeting is maximized.

For example, in an architectual decision record call, the architect and business leaders may have the final decision on a change going forward. But to make that decision correctly, they need all of the relevant information to make the right decision. They want the people who are the experts to feel safe so they can share any reluctance on a particular decision, so they don't make the final call based on incomplete or incorrect information. So given all of this, the honest, safe talk is valuable to all parties involved. The expert individuals have their opinions valued, and the leaders have all the information they need to make the right decision. Everyone wins in this scenario.

I heard stories of founders of a company getting together after hours in a restuarant, and having very honest conversations on the direction of products. This was a small, tight group of friends, and the arguments got very heated at times. But at the end of the conversation, they would all agree on a specific path forward, and would agree that all of them would put their best effort to see that it succeeded.

So we can give a strong support to Hume's statement. When there is strong, safe talk, even when there is disagreement, the final outcome will be based on the best information and will always trend towards the right decision.
